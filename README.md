## Venus Bot

Venus is a GroupMe bot that is designed to take advantage of a flaw in the way GroupMe handles the addition of new bots being added to chats. 

The popular bot Gort is used by admins of large GroupMe's to control the amount of messages sent, ban users who are disruptive, and provide basic statistics about the group and its users.

Venus can take advantage of GroupMe's bot addition flaw to circumvent Gort's (and most other similar security bots) anti-bot feature, opening the door for potentially harmful usage against large, well established groups.

After this security flaw was discovered, I made Venus as a proof of concept for the dangers of this exploit and contacted GroupMe immediately about the issue. Since then, the flaw has been patched and Venus is no longer an operational bot.
